    <h1>Rules</h1>
    <p>
      These are the current rules for ##werewolf.<br /> Breaking these rules may lead to a stasis (prevents you from joining games) or a ban.
    </p>
    <h3>Channel rules</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Use common sense.</li>
      <li>Be nice to each other. No bigotry. <span style="color: white">Seriously, don't rage at each 
other.</span></li>
      <li>Keep the channel family-friendly / safe for work.</li>
      <li>Unauthorized bots, public logging and/or related activities are not permitted.</li>
      <li>Automated messages to the channel, including but not limited to anti-idle scripts, away notifications and similar, are not allowed.</li>
      <li>Don't spam. This includes, but is not limited to:</li>
      <li style="list-style-type: none">
        <ul>
          <li>Manually highlighting people.</li>
          <li>Spamming and/or abusing !start or other bot commands.</li>
          <li>Posting text longer than 3 lines. Use a pastebin like <a href="https://gist.github.com/">Gist</a> or <a href="http://pastebin.com/">Pastebin.com</a>.</li>
          <li>Posting ASCII art. If you really have to, use a pastebin or link to a picture.</li>
          <li>Posting garbage or other worthless messages.</li>
          <li>Excessive shouting (CAPS LOCK). <span style="color: white">It's equally bad if your Shift key is hanging.</span></li>
          <li>Abusing colours.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Don't advertise other channels.</li>
      <li>Ops' decisions are final. If you want to discuss your issue in a civilized manner, take it to ##werewolf-ops.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Gameplay rules</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Players may not share information or be involved in gameplay-related communications after dying (including dead vengeful ghosts).</li>
      <li>Don't play with clones. Any player found to be using clones will immediately be banned from the game.</li>
      <li>Don't post private messages or screenshots of private messages during the game to prove your role, regardless whether real or not.</li>
      <li>Don't use /whois idle times.</li>
      <li>Don't make tedious hints. Hashing/encoding hints and messing with colors can be uncreative and boring. If asked to stop doing it, stop and find a more fun way of hinting.</li>
      <li>Don't !quit or !leave after a game has started unless you <em>really</em> need to leave.</li>
      <li>Automatic sharing of game-related information, including but not limited to automated messages to the bot or other players, is not permitted.</li>
      <li>Waiting for timeouts is discouraged.</li>
    </ul>
